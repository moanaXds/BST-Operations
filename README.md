A comprehensive C++ implementation of Binary Search Tree with core operations and advanced algorithms for successor/predecessor finding and pre-order reconstruction.

## Files

- `BST.cpp` - Complete BST implementation with traversal, insertion, deletion, and search
- `q1.cpp` - Find in-order successor/predecessor in O(h) time
- `q2.cpp` - Reconstruct BST from pre-order in O(N) time
-  BST_GAMER.cpp
  
**Features**:
- Single traversal from root
- O(h) time complexity
- Handles all node positions (leaf, internal, root)
- Reconstruct BST from pre-order array in O(N) time
  
- ### Gamer Leaderboard System (`BST_GAMER.cpp`)
**Complete player management system using BST sorted by rank:**
- **Add Players** - Insert gamers with name, rank, and accuracy
- **Search by Rank** - O(h) search to find specific players
- **Display Leaderboard** - Sorted in-order traversal by rank
- **Remove Lowest Accuracy** - Find and delete player with minimum accuracy
- **Interactive Menu** - User-friendly console interface
