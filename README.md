A comprehensive C++ implementation of Binary Search Tree with core operations and advanced algorithms for successor/predecessor finding and pre-order reconstruction.

## Files

- `BST.cpp` - Complete BST implementation with traversal, insertion, deletion, and search
- `q1.cpp` - Find in-order successor/predecessor in O(h) time
- `q2.cpp` - Reconstruct BST from pre-order in O(N) time

- 
**Features**:
- Single traversal from root
- O(h) time complexity
- Handles all node positions (leaf, internal, root)

### Question 2: Pre-order Reconstruction  
**Problem**: Reconstruct BST from pre-order array in O(N) time
